Big O categorizes your algorithm time or memory based on the input. 
To simply put, how will your algorithm react when the input changes
With BigO, as your input grows how fast does your computation or memory grows.

Why Big O?
With Big O, it will help us make decisions about what data structures and algorithms to use 

Concepts:
1. Grows is with respect to the input. 
2. Constants are always dropped.
3. Worst cases is usually the way we measure.
